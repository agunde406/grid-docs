A great way to contribute is by reporting issues. Before reporting an issue,
please review the current open issues to see if someone has already reported
the issue.

## Using JIRA

Hyperledger Grid uses JIRA as our issue tracking system:

<https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/GRID>

## How to Report an Issue

To report issues, log into [jira.hyperledger.org](https://jira.hyperledger.org),
which requires a
[Linux Foundation Account](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/).

Create issues in JIRA under the Hyperledger Grid project, which uses the
`GRID` JIRA key.

When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible about how to
reproduce it. If possible, explain how to reproduce the issue.  Details are
very helpful. Please include the following information:

* OS version
* Grid version
* Environment details (virtual, physical, etc.)
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Actual results
* Expected results

If you would like, you could also describe the issue on RocketChat (see
[Joining the Discussion]({% link community/join_the_discussion.md %}))
for initial feedback before submitting the issue in JIRA.
