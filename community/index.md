Welcome to the Hyperledger Grid community!

We encourage feedback on all aspects of Hyperledger Grid,
including the high-level design, data models, core components, example SDKs and
libraries, and the developer experience.
We also welcome contributors, both organizations and individuals, to help
shape project direction, contribute ideas, provide use cases, and work on
specific tools and examples.

* [Join the discussion]({% link community/join_the_discussion.md %}):
  Use the Grid chat or mailing list to discuss ideas, propose new features, or
  just ask questions. Attend Grid contributor meetings on Zoom to discuss
  feature proposals and work in progress.

* [Track issues]({% link community/issue_tracking.md %}):
  We use JIRA to track issues and report defects.

* [Contribute]({% link community/contributing.md %}):
  We welcome contributions to Hyperledger Grid, including bug reports, features
  and enhancements, new examples, and improvements to the documentation.

  **NOTE:** The Grid project requires an RFC (request-for-change proposal) for
  any significant change or new feature. For more information, see the
  [grid-rfcs
  README](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/blob/master/README.md).

* [See our code of conduct]({% link community/code_of_conduct.md %}):
  This project follows the Hyperledger Code of Conduct.
